# POS Front-End App

This is a React POS (Point of Sale) front-end app for the reqliq coding test. In this project, I have utilized core React features such as useState, useReducer, Context API, and incorporated third-party packages like Toastify and React Router DOM. The styling is implemented using Tailwind CSS.
